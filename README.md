# The Unofficial Chuck Norries Web App 
Web app that retrieves and shows jokes from the Official Chuck Norris Jokes API (https://api.chucknorris.io/)

**Usage**
Clone it, configure it (`npm install`) and run it (`npm start`).
Then you can go to [localhost](http://localhost/3000) and enjoy! :D

Disclaimer: This app uses port 3000, so if you need another one you can change it in app.js. (I will fix this eventually)
